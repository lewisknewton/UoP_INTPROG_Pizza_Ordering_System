# INTPROG Pizza Ordering System

A graphical software solution for Nel Mezzo, a takeaway restaurant that requested a new ordering system for pizza orders. This was submitted as the second piece of coursework for the first-year Introduction to Programming (INTPROG) module at the University of Portsmouth.

## Main Features

The core functionality of the application is centred around placing an order, which can contain one or more pizzas. The actions that may be taken as part of the ordering process include:

* adding pizzas
* editing pizzas
* deleting pizzas

As orders and individual pizzas are updated, separate costs are also updated to reflect the changes made.

To simplify the use of the GUI, three different screens have been made available:

* Order Summary
* New Pizza
* Edit/Delete Pizza

### Command-line Interface

For the first two tasks of the assignment, evidence of successful test cases was required. To run example processes in the command-line, run the classes in __pizzaorderingsystem.tests/__.

### Graphical User Interface

For the final task of the assignment, a GUI was required to enable the user to create custom orders. This can be run in __pizzaorderingsystem/__ itself.

## Requirements

This project was programmed using NetBeans 8.1 and so its directory structure will differ to that of other IDEs. It also requires Swing, the widget toolkit, for creating the GUI.
